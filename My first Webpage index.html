        <p>With Quarantine hitting us all of a sudden I wasnt sure on what I would be doing with all my free time,being I am not use to it.But it ended up being a nice little break for me and I enjoyed the time with the family before I headed to college. I would play video games with my brother,We did a pool olympics day,and when I got annoyed of being home I would go on car rides an just jam on some music.</p>
